Install
=======

Formasaurus requires Python 2.7+ or 3.3+,
scipy, numpy, scikit-learn, sklearn-crfsuite and lxml to work.

First, make sure numpy is installed. Then, to install Formasaurus with all
its other dependencies run

::

    pip install formasaurus[with-deps]

These packages may require extra steps to install, so the command above
may fail. In this case install dependencies manually, on by one, and
then run::

    pip install formasaurus
